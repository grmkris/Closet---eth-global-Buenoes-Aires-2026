## 🎯 JUDGE Q&A RESPONSE GUIDE

### Expected Questions & Responses

**Q: "Why didn't you implement [feature X]?"**

**A:** "We chose depth over breadth. In 48 hours, we wanted to prove the hard parts work—real AI vision, real payment infrastructure, real outfit generation. We didn't want to fake a complete feature set with mockups. The missing pieces are features we know how to build. The hard technical problems are solved."

**Delivery:** Confident, not defensive. Own the decision.

---

**Q: "How is this different from Stitch Fix / Thread / existing styling services?"**

**A:** "Three key differences: First, we work with your existing wardrobe—not just new purchases or subscription boxes. Second, we're building autonomous agents with verifiable trust, not human stylists with manual processes. Third, we're infrastructure—this is a platform for ANY stylist to create agents, not a closed service. Stitch Fix is bounded by human hours. We scale infinitely."

**Delivery:** Clear differentiation, emphasize the platform play.

---

**Q: "Where's the Triple-Verified Stack? I thought Nethermind was a sponsor?"**

**A:** "Great question. The architecture is designed for it. We integrated CDP for the payment rails, which is the foundation. In 48 hours, we prioritized proving AI works and payments work. The verification layer—AP2 intents, TEE attestation, ERC-8004 reputation—that's the next sprint. But here's what matters: the system is designed with those contracts in mind. We didn't hack it together. We built it right."

**Delivery:** Honest, technical, show you understand the stack deeply.

---

**Q: "What's your business model?"**

**A:** "Three-sided marketplace. Stylists create agents and earn 70% of subscriptions. Users pay $10-50/month for expert fashion help that actually executes. Platform takes 30%. At scale: 1,000 agents × 100 users each = 100K users × $10/month = $1M monthly revenue. Fashion is our beachhead, but this is infrastructure for all autonomous agents."

**Delivery:** Quick, confident, shows you've thought about sustainability.

---

**Q: "Why fashion? Seems trivial."**

**A:** "Fashion is the perfect testbed for autonomous agents. One: mistakes aren't catastrophic—wrong shirt won't crash your portfolio. Two: feedback is immediate—you wear it tomorrow, you know if it works. Three: high frequency means lots of data for reputation systems. Four: massive market—$1.7 trillion. Once we prove agents can be trusted with fashion, the model scales to high-stakes domains. Fashion first, everything next."

**Delivery:** Flip the "trivial" framing. Fashion is strategic, not limiting.

---

**Q: "What's your moat? Anyone can copy this."**

**A:** "First-mover in trusted autonomous commerce. We're solving the hard problem: making AI agents you can trust with real money. The moat isn't just the code—it's the trust layer we're building. As agents build reputation on-chain via ERC-8004, that becomes portable professional identity. Plus, network effects: more users attract more agents, more agents attract more users, more transactions strengthen the reputation system. Fashion is our wedge, but the trust infrastructure we're building becomes rails for all autonomous agents."

**Delivery:** Show depth of thinking beyond the MVP.

---

**Q: "How do you handle returns, disputes, bad purchases?"**

**A:** "That's exactly why the Triple-Verified Stack matters. Every purchase creates an on-chain claim via ERC-8004. If a user disputes, the outcome is recorded and affects reputation. Agents with high dispute rates lose reputation and users. The market self-regulates. Plus, we have standard e-commerce integrations—returns work through retailer policies. But the key innovation is cryptographic proof of intent, process, and outcome. You can prove what you authorized and what the agent actually did."

**Delivery:** Show you've thought about the messy real-world stuff.

---

**Q: "What are you asking for / what happens after the hackathon?"**

**A:** "Short term: We want to win sponsor prizes and get feedback from CDP, Polygon, and Nethermind teams. We're using their tech deeply, not superficially—this is a great test case for x402 and autonomous commerce. Medium term: Deploy to testnet with Triple-Verified Stack, onboard beta stylists, launch agent marketplace. Long term: This becomes infrastructure. We're building the trust layer that makes autonomous agent economies possible."

**Delivery:** Clear vision, shows you're thinking beyond the weekend.

---

### Sponsor-Specific Talking Points

**For Polygon Judges:**
- "We chose Polygon specifically for x402. This is the future of agent-to-agent commerce. Your AutoPay protocol is perfect for subscriptions, and the payment rails enable autonomous purchasing."
- "We're building on Polygon PoS for speed and low gas costs—essential for micropayments and frequent transactions."
- "Feedback: x402 documentation could use more TypeScript examples. We figured it out, but better types would help."

**For CDP Judges:**
- "We're using two CDP products: Embedded Wallets for users, and we're architected for Server Wallets for agents. Plus x402 Facilitator for the payment layer."
- "This isn't checkbox integration. CDP is core to our architecture. Without your wallet infrastructure, we'd have to build auth, custody, and payments ourselves. You're saving us months."
- "Honest feedback: Server Wallet SDK could use better TypeScript types and more examples for multi-user scenarios."

**For Nethermind Judges:**
- "We designed the system with Triple-Verified Stack from day one. AP2 for intent, TEE for process integrity, ERC-8004 for outcome reputation."
- "In 48 hours, we prioritized proving the AI and payment rails work. The verification layer is architected and ready to implement."
- "This is a real use case for your stack: autonomous commerce needs cryptographic proof of authorization, execution, and outcome. We're building exactly that."
