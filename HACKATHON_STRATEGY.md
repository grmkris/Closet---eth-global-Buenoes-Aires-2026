# Closet - HACKATHON WINNING STRATEGY

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Target Prize Pool: $9,000 - $11,000**

We're targeting 3 sponsors with deep integration rather than spreading thin:
1. **Polygon** ($10k pool) - x402 agentic payments
2. **Coinbase CDP** ($5k x 4 winners) - Agent wallets & infrastructure
3. **Nethermind** ($4k pool) - Triple-verified trust stack

**Core Innovation: Verifiable Agent Commerce**
- x402 for autonomous micropayments
- ERC-8004 for on-chain agent identity
- Triple-Verified Stack for cryptographic trust

## THE WINNING FORMULA

### Why This Combination Wins

1. **All three want x402** - Build once, submit three times
2. **All three want AI agents** - Our core product
3. **Low competition overlap** - Different judging criteria
4. **Technical synergy** - Components work together seamlessly
5. **Real product-market fit** - Not a hackathon toy

### Core Components

#### 1. Autonomous Fashion Agents
- Each stylist creates an AI agent
- Agent has CDP Server Wallet
- Can autonomously shop within user-defined budgets
- Pays for API calls via x402 micropayments

#### 2. Payment Infrastructure (x402)
- Monthly subscriptions via x402 AutoPay
- Micropayments for outfit generation
- Commission splitting (platform → stylist → agent)
- Spending limits enforced on-chain

#### 3. Trust & Verification
- **Intent**: Users sign spending rules with AP2
- **Process**: TEE proves agent followed style algorithm
- **Outcome**: ERC-8004 registry tracks reputation
- **Settlement**: x402 handles payment verification

#### 4. Agent Identity (ERC-8004)
- On-chain registry of verified agents
- Immutable reputation scores
- Links human stylist to AI agent
- Public review system

## DEMO NARRATIVE (2 MINUTES)

### Opening Hook (15 seconds)
"How do you trust an AI with your credit card? We solved this for fashion, but the solution scales to all autonomous agents."

### Problem Statement (20 seconds)
"AI agents promise to shop, book, and transact for us. But without cryptographic verification, they're just chatbots. Closet proves autonomous commerce can work when trust is programmable."

### Solution Demo (60 seconds)
1. **Show agent marketplace** (10s)
   - "Professional stylists create AI agents"
   - "Each agent has an on-chain identity via ERC-8004"

2. **User subscribes** (10s)
   - "Users pay $9.99/month via x402 AutoPay"
   - "They set spending rules: $200/month max"

3. **Agent shops autonomously** (20s)
   - "Agent finds perfect jacket on Nordstrom"
   - "Cryptographically verifies user's intent"
   - "Purchases via x402 with CDP wallet"
   - "Transaction recorded on Polygon"

4. **Trust verification** (20s)
   - "Triple-Verified Stack ensures accountability"
   - "User signed the spending rule (Intent)"
   - "Agent proved it followed algorithm (Process)"
   - "Purchase recorded on-chain (Outcome)"

### Business Model (15 seconds)
"Three-sided marketplace: Stylists earn commissions, users save time, retailers get qualified buyers. Fashion is the beachhead—travel, nutrition, and finance agents follow."

### Closing (10 seconds)
"Closet: Where autonomous agents meet verifiable commerce. Built on Polygon with CDP wallets and Nethermind's Triple-Verified Stack."

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**We're not building a hackathon project. We're building the first working example of verifiable autonomous commerce.**

Fashion is the beachhead. Once we prove agents can shop for clothes with cryptographic trust, the model scales to everything.

**Our unfair advantage:** While others chase prizes, we're solving the fundamental trust problem that's blocking the entire agent economy.

**Let's win this.**
