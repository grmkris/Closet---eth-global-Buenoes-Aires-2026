## SLIDE 1: VISION HOOK
### "The Opening - Must Hook Immediately"

#### Optimized Imagen 3 Prompt:

```
A sophisticated split-composition presentation slide in modern tech startup aesthetic:

LEFT SIDE (60%): A minimalist, organized walk-in closet with high-end fashion items neatly arranged on white floating shelves and chrome hangers. Include: navy blazer, white oxford shirts, dark denim, camel coat, black dress, leather accessories. Soft natural lighting from above creates gentle shadows. Professional fashion photography lighting, clean and aspirational.

RIGHT SIDE (40%): An elegant AI visualization - abstract glowing neural network rendered as flowing light particles in deep blue (#1E40AF) and purple (#7C3AED) gradients. The neural network should have an organic, fluid form that feels intelligent and approachable. Subtle hexagonal blockchain nodes connected by thin luminous lines in the background, creating depth. Particles should appear to be "analyzing" the closet, with light rays connecting AI to clothing items.

CENTER TRANSITION: Smooth gradient blend where the two sides meet, with small data points or light particles flowing from closet to AI, suggesting analysis and understanding.

TOP SECTION: Clean white space occupying top 20% of image for text placement. Very subtle gradient from pure white to slight blue tint.

OVERALL MOOD: Sophisticated, trustworthy, innovative but approachable. Not sci-fi, but elevated everyday technology. Premium fashion meets cutting-edge AI.

COLOR GRADING: Slightly cool temperature, high contrast, professional color correction similar to Apple or Tesla presentation aesthetics.

COMPOSITION: Rule of thirds applied, visual weight balanced, negative space intentional.

AVOID: Cartoon style, overly complex details, cluttered composition, generic stock photo feel, aggressive colors, dated UI elements.

Technical specs: 16:9 aspect ratio, ultra-high resolution, presentation-optimized contrast and saturation for projector display.
```

#### Presentation Expert Notes:
- **Text Overlay Zone:** Top 20% kept pristine white for "StyleAgent" title
- **Focal Point:** The connection between AI and closet (middle area)
- **Visual Flow:** Eye enters from closet (familiar), flows to AI (innovation)
- **Emotional Beat:** "This is premium, this is real, this is the future"

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
### "Three Pain Points - Relatable Frustration"

#### Optimized Imagen 3 Prompt:

```
A modern three-panel triptych layout for a presentation slide showing fashion pain points:

PANEL 1 - DECISION FATIGUE (Left third):
A professional millennial woman in business casual attire standing in front of an overflowing closet at 7am (visible wall clock). Morning light streaming through window. She's holding her phone in one hand (showing time: 7:15am), other hand on forehead in classic frustration gesture. Closet shows 50+ items crammed together, creating visual chaos. Shot from slightly elevated angle. Color palette: slightly desaturated blues and grays to convey morning stress. Photorealistic style, editorial photography quality.

PANEL 2 - WARDROBE WASTE (Center third):
A clean, well-lit wardrobe shot focusing on clothing items that clearly have never been worn - visible price tags attached, some items still in dry cleaning plastic, a few with those cardboard tag holders. Dust particles visible in the light beam. Items include: trendy pieces that didn't work out (neon blazer, sequined top), impulse purchases (3 identical black jeans), aspirational pieces (gym wear, fancy dress). Composition emphasizes the waste. Photorealistic product photography style, slight melancholy mood.

PANEL 3 - SHOPPING PARALYSIS (Right third):
Over-the-shoulder view of someone at a laptop with exactly 27 browser tabs open showing different e-commerce sites: Nordstrom, ASOS, Zara, Everlane, etc. Shopping carts visible with items abandoned. Multiple windows showing price comparison tools, reviews, "similar items" recommendations. Coffee cup and notebook with scribbled notes. Evening lighting (blue hour) coming through window, laptop screen glow on face. Creates feeling of overwhelm. Photorealistic lifestyle photography.

VISUAL UNITY: Each panel has a thin vertical border in light gray (#E5E7EB) separating them. Consistent depth of field and lighting quality across all three. Bottom 15% of each panel has subtle gradient to white for text label placement.

COLOR TREATMENT: Muted, slightly desaturated palette to convey problem/pain. Cool tones (blues, grays) dominate. Not depressing, but clearly showing friction.

COMPOSITION: Each panel is perfectly balanced within its third. Visual weight evenly distributed across the triptych. Clear focal point in each (woman's face, price tags, browser tabs).

TYPOGRAPHY SPACE: Clean white band at bottom of each panel (15% height) for labels "Decision Fatigue" | "Wardrobe Waste" | "Shopping Paralysis"

AVOID: Overly dramatic expressions, stock photo clichés, fake UI screenshots, cluttered backgrounds, inconsistent lighting between panels, cartoonish style.

Technical specs: 16:9 aspect ratio, optimized for high-contrast display, consistent color grading across all panels.
```

#### Presentation Expert Notes:
- **Visual Strategy:** Show real problems people immediately recognize
- **Emotional Arc:** Frustration → Regret → Overwhelm (builds case for solution)
- **Relatability:** Specific details (27 tabs, 7:15am) make it feel true
- **Design Principle:** Consistent treatment = professional polish

## GLOBAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR ALL SLIDES

### Visual Hierarchy Rules:
1. **One focal point per slide** - Eye knows where to land
2. **Text zones preserved** - Top 15-20% kept clear for titles
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Complexity revealed, not dumped
4. **Breathing room** - White space is a feature, not wasted space

### Color Psychology:
- **Blues:** Trust, technology, professionalism
- **Purples:** Innovation, AI, future
- **Greens:** Success, verification, go
- **Orange:** Attention, urgency, in-progress
- **White:** Clarity, premium, clean

### Typography Best Practices:
- **Contrast ratios:** Minimum 4.5:1 for readability
- **Font sizes:** Readable from 20 feet away (16pt minimum for body)
- **Hierarchy:** 3 levels maximum (headline, body, caption)
- **Alignment:** Consistent grid, never random placement

### Professional Polish Checklist:
- ✅ Consistent shadows across all UI elements
- ✅ Unified color palette throughout
- ✅ Same style of icons (all line, or all solid, never mixed)
- ✅ Rounded corners consistent (8px, 12px, or 16px - pick one system)
- ✅ Photography style consistent (all lifestyle, or all product, etc.)
